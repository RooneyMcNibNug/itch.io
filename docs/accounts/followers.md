## Why should I follow other accounts?

Following another account on itch.io is a simple way to stay up to date with
what they're doing. You can follow as many accounts as you like. In order to
get the most out of itch.io we recommend following everyone you find
interesting.

Here are some things that will happen once you're following someone:

* Your [Feed][my_feed] will be populated with the activity of the account you followed. This includes, but is not limited to: new games published, games rated, things added to collections, devlog & blog posts written.
* When that account publishes a new game, you'll get an email notification about it (assuming you haven't disabled notifications in your account settings)
* The person you followed will get a notification, making them feel warm inside

So, in conclusion, following someone is a simple way to support them and keep
track of their latest activity. On top of that, following more people helps you
craft your feed into a great source of the latest happenings in the indie game
dev world.

### Who should I follow?

That's for you to decide! We generally recommend following anyone that you've
positively interacted with. No need to be picky, if you end up not liking what
they do you can always unfollow them later.

The itch.io site suggests people for you to follow based on your activity as
well. You can find your suggestions on your homepage and on [your
feed][my_feed].

### Where can I see who I follow?

If you go to [your feed][my_feed], you can click the **followers** and
**following** section to see who your followers are and who's following you.

## Why should I try to get more followers?

If you're a game developer of creator on itch.io then getting followers can be
an effective way to build your audience. Aside from boosting your account's
cred on itch.io, having more followers means having more people you can market
your work too.

* New games or projects you release will be emailed to your followers
* New devlog posts, and any other account activity, will be published to your followers' feeds
* If a project of yours goes on sale then anyone who follows you and doesn't own it yet is eligible for an email notification for the sale

Having a strong follower base means that the next time you launch a project on
itch.io you'll be maximizing the number of people who see it.  This can be an
important part of getting your project to rise up in our listings or have a
chance at being featured on our homepage.

### What's the best way to get more followers?

itch.io loves helping developers get more followers. We have many reminders for
anyone who positively interacts with your project. This includes whenever
someone purchases, downloads, or rates your project.

This may not be enough though, so we also recommend creators to manually
promote their itch.io pages as well. Telling someone to follow you outright
isn't the most effective approach, so we recommend you include some incentive
as well! Here's an example:

> If you want see my progress you can follow my itch.io page here: YOUR URL

Or if you have a completed project:

> Did you like my game XXX, you can get updates by following my itch.io page: YOUR URL

You can suggest to follow you  by linking to your profile page. Posting on
social media, your blog, and other websites is a good way to increase your
audience.

If you have a completed work then you can also suggest someone gives you a
follow directly within your game. For HTML games, you can consider suggesting a
follow after someone has played your game for a bit.
