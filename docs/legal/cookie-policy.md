}

A cookie is a small piece of data that allows your browser to maintain a
session when visiting different pages on our website. If you use Itch.io or any
sites contained within our domain, `itch.io`, then both first and third party
cookies may be set when you access the site.

This policy describes how itch.io, and any third parties it embeds, use
cookies, and what data those cookies may collect.

## Cookie Usage

Our cookie usage falls into two categories:

**Account Sessions**: Cookies are used for logging into user accounts, and
storing data about your preferences for browsing. Additionally, these cookies
are used for security measures like [Cross Site Request
Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))
protection.

**Analytics**: We use cookies to track usage activity in order to make business
decisions and build a better product. Additionally, we make aggregate data
available to the Publishers on our platform with information on how their
products are accessed. This includes things like: referring pages, how many
times their page was viewed, files that were downloaded, etc.

## What Information is Collected About Me

Generally, the data we collect from you is via form submission. Some data,
though, is determined from your browsing history. This can include things like
user preferences, and sessions identification tokens.
