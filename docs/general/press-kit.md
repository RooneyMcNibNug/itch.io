## About

**itch.io** is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games.

It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created, using
[tools](https://itch.io/developers) that are powerful, flexible, and accessible
to everyone.

Launched in 2013 by [Leaf Corcoran](http://leafo.net/), itch.io is run by a
small, [geographically distributed team](https://itch.io/docs/general/team)
committed to quality products, [open source](https://github.com/itchio)
software, and supporting diversity among creators and creations alike.

Over 140,000 games are currently available for sale or download through the
store and its [desktop app](https://itch.io/app). In March 2016, Leaf
[announced](https://twitter.com/moonscript/status/708742688196075521) the site
had paid out just over 1 million dollars to creators. As of 2018 over 7 million
dollars has been collected on behalf of creators.
