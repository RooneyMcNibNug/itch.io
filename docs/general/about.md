}

**itch.io** is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a
focus on independent video games. It's a platform that enables anyone to sell
the content they've created. As a seller you’re in charge of how it’s done: you
set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages. It’s never necessary
to get votes, likes, or follows to get your content approved, and you can make
changes to how you distribute your work as frequently as you like.

itch.io is also a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and
independent creations you'll find on the web. We're not your typical digital
storefront, with a wide range of both paid and free content, we encourage you to
look around and see what you find.

**itch.io** gives creators the tools to make smart choices about how they
distribute their content. Creators have access to detailed analytics and about
how people discover, download, or play what they've created. Our creator
dashboard gives easy access to data about what uploads resonate the most or
what links drive the most attention.

Our strong emphasis on empowering creators show in how build itch.io:

* We do not believe in exploiting content. Creators should be proud of the pages
  that display their work. They should never contain advertisements,
  distracting banners, links to other people's pages, or any other links they
  didn't approve of.

* We believe in making it easy for creators to collect money for their creations
  in a non-obtrusive way. No matter how large or small the project, it should
  be simple for fans to donate or pay what they think is fair.

Every creator is unique, so we support a wide range of methods to help them make
a living. All purchases and donations on itch.io are *pay-what-you-want*
above the minimum. The minimum price can be set to zero: it's free, but fans can
choose to support the creator if they like what they're offering. itch.io
supports pre-orders, selling rewards, creating early-access content, bundling
your content, and even doing crowdfunding with project goals.

## Open revenue sharing

Most marketplaces have a fixed rate applied to all transactions. For most online
distributors the standard has become 30%. When itch.io launched, it took a
0% cut of all transactions.

Since March 2015, itch.io has an open revenue sharing model.  Sellers can
now apply the *pay what you want* model towards itch.io: the revenue split
between the seller and itch.io is configurable by the seller. Set it to 10%,
30%, or even 0%.

You might be thinking "that sounds pretty risky, what if everyone sets it to
zero?" That's a risk we're willing to take in the spirit of encouraging the
generous and supportive community that's already developed around itch.io.

If you like what we're doing please help spread awareness around itch.io.
Encourage your friends or favorite developers to upload their games so we can
build a marketplace whose primary goal is to support the creators it hosts.

Thanks,  
-- The itch.io team
