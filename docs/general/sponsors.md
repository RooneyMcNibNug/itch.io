## Who We Want To Work With

At itch.io, we have a lot of respect for the people who use our platform. We
want to build a product that they enjoy, and is respectful of their attention.
We thrive on supporting independent creators, and provide a space for others to
discover their work. We want to work with a group or product that we feel
comfortable about endorsing and shares similar values. As a sponsor you'll get
the most value by resonating with our audience.

## Prerequisites

We support both text and banner creatives. Only static images are allowed. No
sound, video, or anything that may be considered obtrusive.  Images must be
uploaded to our server, and changes must be approved. No tag code, arbitrary
JavaScript, or `iframe`s are permitted on our pages. Images and links can go to
any link that can be opened in a web browser.

## Placements

We offer a few different placements depending on what kinds of users you are
looking to engage with:

* **After downloading** -- Shown to engaged consumers of games and other digital content, can be filtered to specific content types (games, comics, etc.)
* **Developer dashboard** -- Shown daily to thousands of highly engaged game developers and content creators (highly limited availability)
* **Email digest** -- Our bi-weekly digest sent broadly to people interested in projects hosted on our site
* **More...** -- Have an idea for a placement? Tell us and we'd be glad to chat
