Interacting with your fans is important component to building and marketting a
successful project. **itch.io** lets you do that in several different ways.

## Sending emails

If you have a page for sale, you can send an email to all your buyers via
itch.io. Do so via the *Interact* tab, in the *email* section. You can include
the buyer's purchase URL at the bottom of any email you send to make sure they
can easily access any files you may have updated.

There are a couple things to keep in mind:

* Every email has an easy access unsubscribe link, avoid spamming your fans or you might lose access to them.
* You can only send at most one email per day, so make sure to proof-read before sending one out.
* You won't be able to write an email before you make your first sale.

## Enabling comments

From the *Edit project* page, you can enable comments. Anyone with an
**itch.io** account will be able to participate to the discussion.

Comments are threaded and can be voted upon - you can pick from 'upvotes only',
'up & down votes', and 'no voting at all' from the *Comments* tab

## Enabling a community

If a comment thread doesn't fit your needs you can also enable an entire
message board for your project's page. On the *Edit project* page, directly
below the option for comments, you'll find the option to enable a discussion
board. A discussio board contains all the features of any community on itch.io:
full control over the content posted along with the ability elect moderators,
stick topics, and set rules.

## Keeping an eye on the ratings

From the *Interact* tab of the *Edit project* page, you can see a list of
ratings left by your fans. You can sort them by date and score.

## Showcasing press links

Next to ratings, you can see Press links added by press accounts on **itch.io**.
Feel free to pick two or three of those to quote and link to from your project's
page.
