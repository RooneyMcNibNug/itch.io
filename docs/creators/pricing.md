On **itch.io** any item that can accept money is automatically "pay what you
want" or "pay any amount above the minimum", yet there are many more options
to let you set the right pricing for your content.

## Pay what you want pricing

If you're giving your content away for free downloaders will still have the
opportunity to send you money before they download. If set a minimum price on
your content then buyers can pay that amount, or anything above.

Just by having this feature, **itch.io** is giving developers a significant
boost in profits!

## Purchase tiers & bonus content

A good way to encourage someone to spend more on your content is to add
additional content priced above the minimum.

**itch.io** lets you set minimum prices on individual files. For example, if
you're selling a game for $$1 you could offer the option to get access to the
soundtrack when paying $$2 or more.

You can even added priced files when your project is normally free. Encourage a
donation by offering additional content like levels or music. For example, you
could offer a level pack for $$2 with an otherwise free game.

## Sales & bundles

Discounts are another effective way to drive more purchases to your project.
Instead of manipulating the price directly, simply create a sale -- you can
decide when it starts and ends, how deep the discount is, which of your
projects are included, and even set a bundle price.

**itch.io** also lets you team up with other content creators and organize
a bundle of your respective wares entirely from the comfort of your dashboard.

## Early access

You can easily implement an *Early access* model using **itch.io**. Simply
set the release status to **In development** in the project's edit page,
upload the current version of your project, set a minimum price, and
you're all set.

Once someone buys your early access project, they will have access to
all future updates. You can even let them know by e-mail when a new version
is out, or encourage them to follow you on itch.io so that they see
all your activity in their feed.

## Pre-orders

A project is a *pre-order* if all its public uploads have the *This file is a
pre-order placeholder* checkbox ticked. It will allow buyers to purchase before
uploads are made available.

## Project goals

You can set a goal on any [sale][sales]. This enables a banner on the project page,
displaying how much has been collected, and the progress made towards the
current goal.
