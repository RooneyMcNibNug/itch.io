## Layout

**itch.io** project pages are designed to be as non-obtrusive and flexible,
giving control to the creator to display their content however they want.
Unlike other traditional stores, we don't force unrelated content on your
pages, so you have plenty of space for your project's presentation.

In order to get the most out of itch.io we recommend you spend some time with
our theme editing tools to make something that matches the style of your game
or project. When we look for content to feature or promote, we like to see
projects that participate in the culture of itch.io by extending the experience
of their game to their itch.io page.

Project pages can come in two varations: a **single column** and a **two column** mode.
For downloadable projects, the two column mode is enabled by default. It
displays your screenshots and video on the right, with your project's main
content on the left. For HTML5, and other embedded content, we default to a
single column mode that hides the screenshot column. Regardless of the default,
you can swith to the alternate variation from the theme editor to fit you
taste.

> If you're not using the screenshots column on your project page, then we
> highlight recommend you still find a way to show images for your project. You
> can do this by embedding images into your description.

The primary column of your project page includes the following sections:

* **The description** -- This the text and content you've provided on your project's edit page
* **More information** -- A collapsible section that shows additional metadata about your project's page like tags, rating, publish date, and more. It's collapsed by default to not be obtrusive
* **Download area** -- Any files available for download will be listed on your page, along with a download button
* **Purchase area** -- Files available for purchase or donation will be displayed with a *Buy* button, instead of the regular download area
* **Project blog** -- If you're using our [Devlogs](https://itch.io/updates/introducing-devlogs) functionality then a list of the most recent posts will be linked from your page
* **Community or comments** -- Depending on if you've enabled a discussion board or comments, you'll get a new section on your page showing the respective community


## What to put in the description

Your page's description is how people learn about your project, so it's
important to be complete and informative. Here are some ideas to get you
started:

* A **Credits** section with everyone who participated to the project
* **Contact information** for your fans / buyers
* If it's a digital project, minimum and **recommended specs** to run it
* A list of **controls** and supported input devices
* A quick summary of the story, if any
* A list of features if your project is a tool or a game
* If the project is still in development, its current status and
what's planned for it.
* A list of **links** where fans can find out more about your project

> You can edit the description in the *Edit game* form. To create different text
> sections, use the **Header 2** style for titles, they'll appear like
> site-generated headers like *Purchase*, *Download instructions*, etc.

## The itch.io theme editor

$image_carousel{

    src = "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzkwODkxMy5wbmc=/original/LLA3lv.png",
    alt="The itch.io theme editor"
  },
  height=300
}

On the page of any project you're allowed to edit you'll find an *Edit Theme*
button on the top of the page. Clicking it will open the interactive theme
editor.

From there you can change things like:

* Background, text, button colors
* Header image
* Background images
* Fonts
* & More

For some inspiration on designing your own page, here's a collection of
projects that have interesting page designs: [Cool Game
Pages](https://itch.io/c/1536/cool-game-pages).

Here are some tips for using the different components:

### Changing the color scheme

Four elements make up the color scheme of any itch.io project page.

The **BG** color is the background of the entire page, whereas the **BG2**
color appears on the column where the content of the page is. You can control
the opacity of the column with the **BG2 Alpha** located in the *More options*
area under the color controls

Other colors you can change include **Text** for the color of regular text, and
**Link** for the color of hyperlinks and buttons. You can use the **Buttons**
color to set a color for buttons separate from links, and **Headers** color to
change how the page headers appear.

### Images: banner & background

The banner is probably the most important graphic part of your page as it's
the first thing new visitors set their sights on. It can be a semi-transparent
PNG, it could be an animated GIF (some particle effects around the title
letters?). Let your imagination run a little.

When a banner is uploaded to an itch.io page, it replaces the title otherwise
shown just above the description.

The background is more subtle, but it can achieve cool effects, see for example
how [this page](http://breakingbytes.itch.io/xydonia) uses a
vertically-repeating background to create styled column.

### Font face and size

You can customize the font of your page, and separately the font of only the
page headers from the dropdowns located in the **Text** section on the theme
editor.

In addition handful of presets, we make available every font that is on [Google
Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). There are a few thousand fonts to choose
from so we recommend browsing on the [Google Fonts
website](https://fonts.google.com/) so you can preview types and their
pairings.

### Layout options

The **Layout** section of the theme editor lets you control the overall layout
of the page.

**Screenshots**:

* **Sidebar** -- Your page will have two columns, the rightmost column will contain screenshots and your trailer
* **Hidden** -- Your page will only have a single column, if you've uploaded any screenshots they're hidden
* **Auto** -- Automatically choose **Hidden** for project pages with game embeds, otherwise use **Sidebar**

### Custom CSS

If you'd like to customize both your pages beyond what the theme editor allows,
you can simply [get in touch][support] with us and ask for custom CSS to be
enabled for your account. In your message please include the list of changes
you intend to make.

If we see many people making the same custom CSS customizations then we may
make the option available in our theme editor.

For some ideas on how you might use CSS, here's a collection of interesting
pages: [CSS Showcase](https://itch.io/c/241703/css-showcase).

## Video URL / Trailer

Especially for games, we highly recommend people provide a link to video for
their game.

**YouTube**, **Vimeo**, and **SketchFab** links are supported. The video player
is shown above the screenshots, in the secondary column. This is a good place
to put a trailer or any other form of short presentation or promotion for the
project.

Adding a video to a project page enables the *Watch trailer* button one can
use from the pop-over in grid listings (ie. the various browse pages of
**itch.io**).

> Make sure that the video you embed is publicly accessible! In fact,
> checking your page using the *Incognito* mode of your browser is always
> a good idea.

## Mobile web pages

All project pages are *responsive*, they dynamically adjust to the width of the
screen to stay usable on a variety of devices. If you're making heavy
customizations to your page we recommend to check that your page displays
correctly at smaller resolutions by shrinking your browser window or using your
browser's mobile developer tools.

## External links

From the Metadata panel on your project editor you can provide *External
links*: a list of links that point to your project or any information about
your project on other websites. At the moment, the links you add are displayed
on the download page for your project, but we'll likely add them in more
places. You can provide links to places like:

* Kickstarter
* Twitter
* Steam Greenlight
* Ludum Dare

Along with generic items like *Support*, *Community*, and *Homepage*.
