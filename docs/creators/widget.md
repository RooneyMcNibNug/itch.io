The itch.io widget is an embeddable piece of HTML that you can put on other
sites that enables visitors to download or buy your content!

<div class="button_row">
<a href="/developers" class="button fat on_logged_out">Create an account with itch.io</a>
<a href="/game/new" class="button fat on_logged_in">Create a new game</a>
<div class="sub">or read on to learn more</div>
</div>

All of **itch.io**'s purchase options are available through the widget, someone
buying or downloading your doesn't have to leave your site to initiate a
purchase. They can pay above the minimum, pay to unlock files, and pay with any
of **itch.io**'s payment providers.

Getting started with the widget is really easy! The first step is to upload a
project. Once you've created the page you can find a link to the widgets panel
for that project either from [your dashboard](http://itch.io/dashboard) page or
from the top of the project's page.

> You can easily get embed codes for any page on itch.io by clicking the *Embed*
> link at the very bottom of the page. A press outlet could use that to allow
> readers to directly buy the game they're reading the review of.

The widget is just a few lines of HTML that you can paste into your blog or
website. It pulls images and description text from the information you've set on
the project edit page. You can also customize the appearance of the widget to be
light or dark to match your website.

## Demonstration

Here's a live example in both light and dark styles.

<iframe src="//itch.io/embed/3" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<iframe src="//itch.io/embed/3?dark=true" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The widget can be used for web games as well, instead of including links to
download or purchase it will link back to your game page on itch.io.
